**Icon Shelf** is a free SVG icon organizer and manager for web developers.

Working on a frontend project, you most likely would have a ton of SVG icons as
assets. Managing them, finding specific icons and importing them to code can be a bit of a struggle sometimes.
Icon Shelf is here to solve all of this and more.

Link the icons folder to Icon Shelf and see all your icons in an easily previewable manner. And with one click you copy the icon's code import statement to the clipboard.
