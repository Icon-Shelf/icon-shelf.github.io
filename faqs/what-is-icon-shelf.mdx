**Icon Shelf** is a free SVG icon organizer and manager for web developers.

Working on a frontend project, you most likely would have a ton of SVG icons as
assets. Managing them, finding specific icons and importing them to code can be a bit of a struggle sometimes.
Icon Shelf is here to solve all of these and more.

Link the icons folder to Icon Shelf and see all your icons in an easily previewable manner. And with a click, copy to clipboard the import statement for the icon to be used in code.
