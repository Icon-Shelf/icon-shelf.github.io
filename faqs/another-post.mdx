To sync icons on multiple devices, open Settings panel in Iconset, and locate Library section. Click Move button to move your current icon library into Dropbox/iCloud Drive/Box/OneDrive etc. shared folder.

Make sure all team members have access to your icon library folder, then click Switch button to choose that library. All set! Now whenever the folder synced through Dropbox or OneDrive clients on your computer, Iconset always keeps your icons updated.
