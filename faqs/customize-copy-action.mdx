Icon Shelf gives you a variety of options to copy icon to code.

![icon context menu](./images/actions-context-menu.png)

All the "copy as code" options are customizable.

Let's customize the "copy as React" option.
And we wan't our icon code import statements to be something like this:

```js
import { ReactComponent as DragHandleIcon } from "assets/drag-handle.svg";
```

<div class="pb-8"></div>

Start by going to the collections option menu and click on **"Customize action"** menu item.

![](./images/collection-action-menu.png)

<div class="pb-8"></div>

You will see a bunch of actions present. Let's focus on "Copy as React".
Click on the edit icon next to "Copy as React".

![image of customize actions popup](./images/customize-action-popup.png)

In the template editor, paste the following code:

```js
import { ReactComponent as <%=  _.upperFirst(_.camelCase(iconName)) %>Icon } from 'assets/${iconRelativeFilePath}';
```

<div class="mb-4"></div>

![template editor](./images/templte-editor.png)

<div class="pb-8"></div>

Go back and click "Done and save".

You should now be able to execute the "Copy as React" action and have the desired import statement copied to clipboard.

### Better understanding the copy template editor

<!-- image of editor -->

This editor is a string builder for customizing the copy to code actions.
You have **variables** such as icon name, path, etc. and functions to build the desired code import statement.

Let's take the following example template to get a better understanding.

```js
import { ReactComponent as <%=  _.upperFirst(_.camelCase(iconName)) %>Icon } from 'assets/${iconRelativeFilePath}';
```

<br></br>

- `import { ReactComponent as` is just plain text to be inserted at the beginning.
- `<%= ... %>` is the execution block. Here you can call JavaScript and [Loadash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#camelCase) functions to transform variables.
  - Breaking down `<%= _.upperFirst(_.camelCase(iconName)) %>Icon` we see:
  - `_.camelCase(iconName)` converts the icon name to camel case. E.g.: dragHandle
  - `_.upperFirst(...)` upper-cases the first letter of the name. E.g.: DragHandle
  - `<%= ... %>Icon` concatenates "Icon" to the end of the text. E.g.: DragHandleIcon
- The last part is `from 'assets/${iconRelativeFilePath}';`
  - here we add "assets" to the beginning of the `iconRelativeFilePath` variable

#### Variables

Some of the variables that can be used in the template editor are:

- iconName - the file name of the icon
- iconRelativeFilePath - the relative file path of the icon based on the collection folder
- iconAbsoluteFilePath - the absolute file path of the icon
- iconFileType - the file type of the icon

#### Function

You can use any of the built-in JavaScript functions like replace, slice, trim...

<div class="-mb-6"></div>
E.g.: `iconName.replace('icon', '')`

<div class="mb-4"></div>
You can also use most of the string functions of [Loadash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#camelCase) in the template execution block.
